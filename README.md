# OBAM
Corpus of offensive Bambara language

## OBAM v1.0
The first version of the corpus contains 4,072 texts written in code-switched Bambara-French, where the texts are labeled as normal (0), offensive (1) and abusive (2). The annotation has been done by three native Bambara speakers from Mali, where we have applied the majority voting to attribute the final label for each text.
